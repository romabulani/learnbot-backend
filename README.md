# JavaScript AI Teacher - Backend

## Overview

This backend serves as the API for the LearnBot application. It allows users to interact with an AI teacher that is an expert in JavaScript. The backend is responsible for handling user authentication, storing chat sessions, managing context, and interfacing with an AI model (Google GenAI) to generate responses for the user.

This backend uses **FastAPI** for the web framework, **WebSocket** for real-time communication, and **MongoDB** for data storage.

---

## Features

- **User Authentication** (Sign-up & Login)
- **Real-Time Chat** using WebSocket
- **Session Management** (Keep track of each userâ€™s session)
- **Message History** (Save and retrieve past messages and sessions)
- **Contextual Memory** (Remembers past conversations for more relevant responses)
- **Google GenAI Integration** (Used for generating AI responses)
- **Database** (MongoDB to store user data, messages, and sessions)

---

## API Endpoints

- **POST /signup**  
- **POST /login**  
- **GET /sessions**
- **POST /sessions**
- **GET /messages**

## WebSocket Endpoint
The WebSocket connection allows real-time communication between the user and the JavaScript AI teacher. It maintains context during the conversation.

## Database
This backend uses MongoDB to store the following:

- User data: Username, hashed password.
- Session data: User's chat sessions.
- Messages: Messages exchanged between the user and the AI.
